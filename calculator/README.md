In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a calculator with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Javascript will be used to create buttons to populate into the DOM and add click handlers to these buttons. For styling, you will learn how to use the grid layout to organize the calculator buttons.

Most importantly, unlike with many other calculator javascript tutorials, we will write out all the logic to do the calculations instead of using the eval function. Eval is a function that evaluates a string as code, which poses a security risk.
